#### TASK 1

##### Part1
1) Log in to the system as root.
```sh
ssh root@192.168.0.9
```

2) Use the passwd command to change the password. Examine the basic
parameters of the command. What system file does it change *?

```sh
[root@localhost ~]# passwd --help
Usage: passwd [OPTION...] <accountName>
  -k, --keep-tokens       keep non-expired authentication tokens
  -d, --delete            delete the password for the named account (root
                          only); also removes password lock if any
  -l, --lock              lock the password for the named account (root only)
  -u, --unlock            unlock the password for the named account (root only)
  -e, --expire            expire the password for the named account (root only)
  -f, --force             force operation
  -x, --maximum=DAYS      maximum password lifetime (root only)
  -n, --minimum=DAYS      minimum password lifetime (root only)
  -w, --warning=DAYS      number of days warning users receives before
                          password expiration (root only)
  -i, --inactive=DAYS     number of days after password expiration when an
                          account becomes disabled (root only)
  -S, --status            report password status on the named account (root
                          only)
      --stdin             read new tokens from stdin (root only)
Help options:
  -?, --help              Show this help message
      --usage             Display brief usage message
```

After changing the password using `` '' passwd`` command, hashes in file /etc/shadow had rewritten.

3) Determine the users registered in the system, as well as what commands they
execute. What additional information can be gleaned from the command
execution?
Output of ```who, w, whoami,id```:

I cauld to use vipw command

I don't have command execution on my CentOS. If you mean ```exec``` command than we can Replace the shell with the given command.
The exec() family of functions replaces the current process image with a new process image. The initial argument for these functions is the name of a file that is to be executed. The functions can be grouped based on the letters following the "exec" prefix.

4) Change personal information about yourself.

5) Become familiar with the Linux help system and the man and info commands.
Get help on the previously discussed commands, define and describe any two
keys for these commands. Give examples.

Or command - ```whatis```

6) Explore the more and less commands using the help system. View the contents
of files .bash* using commands.

more - view the file
less - view file (+ arrows + search) (important for big files bcz command is using cache!)

# bash/zsh git prompt support
#
# Copyright (C) 2006,2007 Shawn O. Pearce <spearce@spearce.org>
# Distributed under the GNU General Public License, version 2.0.
#
# This script allows you to see repository status in your prompt.
#
# To enable:
#
#    1) Copy this file to somewhere (e.g. ~/.git-prompt.sh).
#    2) Add the following line to your .bashrc/.zshrc:
#        source ~/.git-prompt.sh
#    3a) Change your PS1 to call __git_ps1 as
#        command-substitution:
#        Bash: PS1='[\u@\h \W$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")]\$ '
#        ZSH:  setopt PROMPT_SUBST ; PS1='[%n@%m %c$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")]\$ '
#        the optional argument will be used as format string.
#    3b) Alternatively, for a slightly faster prompt, __git_ps1 can
#        be used for PROMPT_COMMAND in Bash or for precmd() in Zsh
#        with two parameters, <pre> and <post>, which are strings
#        you would put in $PS1 before and after the status string
#        generated by the git-prompt machinery.  e.g.
#        Bash: PROMPT_COMMAND='__git_ps1 "\u@\h:\w" "\\\$ "'
#          will show username, at-sign, host, colon, cwd, then
#          various status string, followed by dollar and SP, as
#          your prompt.
#        ZSH:  precmd () { __git_ps1 "%n" ":%~$ " "|%s" }
#          will show username, pipe, then various status string,
#          followed by colon, cwd, dollar and SP, as your prompt.
#        Optionally, you can supply a third argument with a printf
#        format string to finetune the output of the branch status
#
# The repository status will be displayed only if you are currently in a
# git repository. The %s token is the placeholder for the shown status.
#
# The prompt status always includes the current branch name.
#
# In addition, if you set GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE to a nonempty value,
# unstaged (*) and staged (+) changes will be shown next to the branch
# name.  You can configure this per-repository with the
# bash.showDirtyState variable, which defaults to true once
# GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE is enabled.
#
# You can also see if currently something is stashed, by setting
# GIT_PS1_SHOWSTASHSTATE to a nonempty value. If something is stashed,
# then a '$' will be shown next to the branch name.
#
# If you would like to see if there're untracked files, then you can set
# GIT_PS1_SHOWUNTRACKEDFILES to a nonempty value. If there're untracked
# files, then a '%' will be shown next to the branch name.  You can
# configure this per-repository with the bash.showUntrackedFiles
# variable, which defaults to true once GIT_PS1_SHOWUNTRACKEDFILES is
# enabled.
#
# If you would like to see the difference between HEAD and its upstream,
# set GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM="auto".  A "<" indicates you are behind, ">"
# indicates you are ahead, "<>" indicates you have diverged and "="
# indicates that there is no difference. You can further control
# behaviour by setting GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM to a space-separated list
# of values:
#
#     verbose       show number of commits ahead/behind (+/-) upstream
#     name          if verbose, then also show the upstream abbrev name
#     legacy        don't use the '--count' option available in recent
#                   versions of git-rev-list
#     git           always compare HEAD to @{upstream}
#     svn           always compare HEAD to your SVN upstream
#
# You can change the separator between the branch name and the above
# state symbols by setting GIT_PS1_STATESEPARATOR. The default separator
# is SP.
#
# When there is an in-progress operation such as a merge, rebase,
# revert, cherry-pick, or bisect, the prompt will include information
# related to the operation, often in the form "|<OPERATION-NAME>".
#
# When the repository has a sparse-checkout, a notification of the form
# "|SPARSE" will be included in the prompt.  This can be shortened to a
# single '?' character by setting GIT_PS1_COMPRESSSPARSESTATE, or omitted
# by setting GIT_PS1_OMITSPARSESTATE.
#
# By default, __git_ps1 will compare HEAD to your SVN upstream if it can
# find one, or @{upstream} otherwise.  Once you have set
# GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM, you can override it on a per-repository basis by
# setting the bash.showUpstream config variable.
#
# If you would like to see more information about the identity of
# commits checked out as a detached HEAD, set GIT_PS1_DESCRIBE_STYLE
# to one of these values:
#
#     contains      relative to newer annotated tag (v1.6.3.2~35)
#     branch        relative to newer tag or branch (master~4)
#     describe      relative to older annotated tag (v1.6.3.1-13-gdd42c2f)
#     tag           relative to any older tag (v1.6.3.1-13-gdd42c2f)
#     default       exactly matching tag
#
# If you would like a colored hint about the current dirty state, set
# GIT_PS1_SHOWCOLORHINTS to a nonempty value. The colors are based on
# the colored output of "git status -sb" and are available only when
# using __git_ps1 for PROMPT_COMMAND or precmd in Bash,
# but always available in Zsh.
#
# If you would like __git_ps1 to do nothing in the case when the current
# directory is set up to be ignored by git, then set
# GIT_PS1_HIDE_IF_PWD_IGNORED to a nonempty value. Override this on the
# repository level by setting bash.hideIfPwdIgnored to "false".

7) * Describe in plans that you are working on laboratory work 1. Tip: You should
read the documentation for the finger command.

I was using CentOS. The last version of CentOs doesn't have ```finger``` command, the alternative command is ```pinky```

8) * List the contents of the home directory using the ls command, define its files
and directories. Hint: Use the help system to familiarize yourself with the ls
command.
